## Libware:

Libware is designed to assist developers organise their code snippets, you can think of snippets as reusable small part of code, making it easily accessible by individuals or teams, Libware is developed with intention to reduce time that developers take to find a code that they wrote in the past for either use it or just to share it or improve it and  develop it even further.

This is high level of what Libware does and what problem it tries to solve, in term of technology stack I used full stack range of technologies starting from the UI it uses Html5, CSS3 and bootstrap it is responsive and designed to work across all devices Smart phones, tablets, laptops and large screen devices, it uses JQuery with plugins highlightjs that show code in the format that developers are familiar with I also use canvas and javascript to do animation to give it outstanding and modern look and feel, from the backend side I uses Java Spring Boot as it provides easy and clean development workflow and separation of concerns using MVC with mysql database to store all its data and I use hibernate and JPA to connect the Objected oriented side of Java with the relational data structor on my SQL.

The architecture of Spring boot MVC allows me to practice TDD using JUnit and agile in depth by estimating my backlog item and running iterative releases of new features following the roadmap I designed. Please find a presentation about my "Libware" project to demonstrate  what I have been able to achieve through my learning :
